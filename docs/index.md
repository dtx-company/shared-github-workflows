# shared-github-workflows

Github actions used by flowcode to build and deploy services

## Getting started

Start write your documentation by adding more markdown (.md) files to this folder (/docs) or replace the content in this file.

## Table of Contents

The Table of Contents on the right is generated automatically based on the hierarchy
of headings. Only use one H1 (`#` in Markdown) per file.

## Site navigation

Pages will automatically be added to site navigation based on names of markdown files.

## Support

If you need support, [check out the techdocs docs](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/creating-and-publishing) or 
reach out in [#team-sre](https://flowcode.slack.com/messages/C02D2KP8FCK) Slack.
